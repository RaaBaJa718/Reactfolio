      Hi, I’m Ruben, an aspiring full-stack developer embarking on an This
      experience taught me not only the technical foundations of front-end and
      back-end development but also the value of problem-solving, collaboration,
      and writing clean, efficient code. I'm proud of the projects I've built so
      far, including real-world applications that challenged me to turn ideas
      into functional solutions. As someone new to the field, my goal is to
      continue growing my skills and contributing to projects that make a
      meaningful impact. I'm excited to join a team where I can learn from
      experienced developers, embrace new challenges, and create applications
      that enhance people's lives. This is just the beginning, and I can’t wait
      to sexciting journey into the world of software development. Recently, I
      completed a comprehensive Full Stack Bootcamp where I immersed myself in
      building interactive and responsive web applications using technologies
      like React, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize. See what the
      future holds.
